  bio: "I'm a student developer passionate about crafting intelligent and interactive digital experiences. I love building intuitive web apps, experimenting with AI tools, and turning random late-night ideas into real, usable projects. From JavaScript and Next.js to SAP ABAP Cloud and AWS, I enjoy exploring new technologies and creating things that feel smooth, smart, and genuinely useful.",
  about: [
    "Hi, I'm a student developer who still breaks things on purpose - usually to understand how they work, sometimes because JavaScript said ‘trust me’. I spend my time building web apps, AI tools, and anything else that sounds fun at 2 AM.",

"React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Node.js are my usual partners in chaos, and I’m currently navigating the backend wilderness where bugs mysteriously multiply. I work with SAP technologies, ABAP Cloud, and AWS cloud services too - because why fix one ecosystem when you can confuse yourself with three?",

"When I’m not coding, I’m brainstorming startup ideas I’ll definitely start ‘tomorrow’, scrolling through GitHub like it’s Netflix, or confidently explaining why ‘it works on my machine’ still counts. I love creating things that are fast, functional, and just the right amount of chaotic."
